### Installing from Packagist

You can use pie to install the extension from the Packagist repository.
See: <https://packagist.org/packages/valkey-io/valkey-glide-php>

Before starting this step, make sure you've installed all dependencies above.

Additionally, you will need to install the pie tool.

On Linux, you can download pie with curl. eg:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/php/pie/releases/latest/download/pie.phar -o pie
chmod +x pie
sudo mv pie /usr/local/bin/pie
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"
```

On MacOS, install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install pie
```

To install the Valkey Glide extension, simply use the pie command:

```bash
# VERSION can be set to any release tag or branch at https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide-php.git
export VERSION=1.0.0
pie install valkey-io/valkey-glide-php:$VERSION
```

### Installing from PECL

You can install the extension using PECL from GitHub releases:

```bash
# Install from a specific release
pecl install https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide-php/releases/download/v1.0.0/valkey_glide-1.0.0.tgz

# Or download and install manually
wget https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide-php/releases/download/v1.0.0/valkey_glide-1.0.0.tgz
pecl install valkey_glide-1.0.0.tgz
```

After installation, add the extension to your php.ini:

```ini
extension=valkey_glide
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
php -m | grep valkey_glide
php -r "if (extension_loaded('valkey_glide')) echo 'SUCCESS: Extension loaded!'; else echo 'ERROR: Extension not loaded';"
```

#### Building and Installing the Extension from source

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-glide-php.git
    cd valkey-glide-php
    ```

2. Initialize submodules (if not cloned with --recurse-submodules):

    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

3. Build the FFI library (required dependency):

    ```bash
    python3 utils/patch_proto_and_rust.py
    cd valkey-glide/ffi
    cargo build --release
    cd ../../
    ```

4. Build the extension:

    ```bash
    phpize
    ./configure --enable-valkey-glide
    make build-modules-pre
    make install
    ```

5. Enable the extension by adding it to your `php.ini` file:

    ```ini
    extension=valkey_glide
    ```

6. Generate PHP protobuf classes used for testing purposes:

   ```bash
   protoc --proto_path=./valkey-glide/glide-core/src/protobuf --php_out=./tests/ ./valkey-glide/glide-core/src/protobuf/connection_request.proto
   ```

7. Install PHP dependencies with composer:

   ```bash
   composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader
   ```

8. Execute the tests:

    ```bash
    make test
    ```

## Basic Examples

### Standalone Valkey

```php
// Create ValkeyGlide client
$client = new ValkeyGlide();
$client->connect(addresses: [['host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 6379]]);

// Basic operations
$setResult = $client->set('foo', 'bar');
echo "SET result: " . $setResult . "\n";

$getValue = $client->get('foo');
echo "GET result: " . $getValue . "\n";

$pingResult = $client->ping();
echo "PING result: " . $pingResult . "\n";

// Close the connection
$client->close();
```

### PHPRedis-Compatible Class Names

For easier migration from PHPRedis, you can use PHPRedis-compatible class names:

**Standalone:**

```php
// Register PHPRedis compatibility aliases
ValkeyGlide::registerPHPRedisAliases();

// Now you can use Redis instead of ValkeyGlide
$client = new Redis();
$client->connect(addresses: [['host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 6379]]);

$client->set('foo', 'bar');
$value = $client->get('foo');

// Exceptions are also aliased
try {
    // Operations that may fail
} catch (RedisException $e) {
    echo "Caught RedisException: " . $e->getMessage() . "\n";
}

$client->close();
```

**Cluster:**

```php
// Register PHPRedis compatibility aliases
ValkeyGlide::registerPHPRedisAliases();

// Now you can use RedisCluster instead of ValkeyGlideCluster
$cluster = new RedisCluster(
    addresses: [
        ['host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 7001],
        ['host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 7002]
    ]
);

$cluster->set('foo', 'bar');
$value = $cluster->get('foo');

$cluster->close();
```

**Requirements:**

- PHP 8.3 or higher (required for `class_alias()` support with internal classes)

### With IAM Authentication for AWS ElastiCache

```php
// Create ValkeyGlide client with IAM authentication.
$client = new ValkeyGlide();
$client->connect(
    addresses: [['host' => 'my-cluster.xxxxx.use1.cache.amazonaws.com', 'port' => 6379]],
    use_tls: true,  // REQUIRED for IAM authentication
    credentials: [
        'username' => 'my-iam-user',  // REQUIRED for IAM
        'iamConfig' => [
            ValkeyGlide::IAM_CONFIG_CLUSTER_NAME => 'my-cluster',
            ValkeyGlide::IAM_CONFIG_REGION => 'us-east-1',
            ValkeyGlide::IAM_CONFIG_SERVICE => ValkeyGlide::IAM_SERVICE_ELASTICACHE,
            ValkeyGlide::IAM_CONFIG_REFRESH_INTERVAL => 300  // Optional, defaults to 300 seconds
        ]
    ]
);

// Use the client normally - IAM tokens are managed automatically
$client->set('key', 'value');
$value = $client->get('key');
echo "Value: " . $value . "\n";

$client->close();
```

### With TLS

```php
// Create ValkeyGlide client with TLS configuration
$client = new ValkeyGlide();
$client->connect(
    addresses: [['host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 6379]],
    use_tls: true,
    advanced_config: ['tls_config' => ['root_certs' => $root_certs_data]]
);

// Create ValkeyGlide client with TLS stream context
$client = new ValkeyGlide();
$client->connect(
    addresses: [['host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 6379]],
    context: stream_context_create(['ssl' => 'ca-cert.pem'])   
)
```

### Cluster Valkey

```php
// Create cluster client configuration
$addresses = [
    ['host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 7001],
    ['host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 7002],
    ['host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 7003]
];

// Create ValkeyGlideCluster client with multi-database support (Valkey 9.0+)
$client = new ValkeyGlideCluster(
    addresses: $addresses,
    read_from: ValkeyGlide::READ_FROM_PREFER_REPLICA, 
    database_id: 1 // Requires Valkey 9.0+ with cluster-databases > 1
);

// Basic operations
$setResult = $client->set('foo', 'bar');
echo "SET result: " . $setResult . "\n";

$getValue = $client->get('foo');
echo "GET result: " . $getValue . "\n";

$pingResult = $client->ping();
echo "PING result: " . $pingResult . "\n";

// Close the connection
$client->close();
```
